**[Instrumental]**  
`Dm` `Gm` `Bb` `F`  
`Eb` `F` `Eb` `F`  
`Gm` `Bb` `F`  
`Gm` `Bb` `F`  

**[Verse 1]**  
`Gm/D` Past the forest of the flies of fire  
`Bb/D` Beyond the waters of shimmering tears  
`F/C` By a fire they stand  
`Eb` And they whisper my name  

**[Bridge]**  
Now I seek upon the night  
Small fragments of moonlight  

**[Chorus]**  
Up the hill the headstones lie  
Up the hill the reapers watching eye  
Up the hill the headstones lie  
Headstones ...  

**[Verse 2]**  
In the circle of stones dressed in ivy  
By the garden of the serene flowers  
And the spirits are there  
Whispering my name  

**[Bridge]**  
Now I seek upon the night  
Small fragments of moonlight  

**[Chorus]**  
Up the hill the headstones lie  
Up the hill the reapers watching eye  
Up the hill the headstones lie  
Headstones ...
