**[Verse 1]**  
`E` When I look into your `Cm` eyes  
I can see a love `B` restrained  
`E` But darling when I `Cm` hold you  
Don't you know I feel the `B` same  
`Cm` Cause nothin' last `F#` forever  
And we both know hearts can `B` change  
`Cm` And it's hard to hold a `F#` candle  
In the cold november `B` rain  

**[Verse 2]**  
`E` We've been through this such a `Cm` long, long time  
Just tryin' to kill the `B` pain, oh yeah  
`E` But lovers always come and lovers always go  
And `Cm` no one's really sure who's lettin' go `B` today - Walkin' away  
`E` If we could take the time to lay it on the line  
`Cm` I could rest my head - Just knowin' that you were `B` mine - All mine  
`Cm` So if you want to `F#` love me  
Then darlin' don't `B` refrain  
`Cm` Or I'll just end up `F#` walkin'  
In the cold november `B` rain  

**[Chorus]**  
`E` Do you need sometime on your `F#` own?  
`E` Do you need sometime all `F#` alone?  
`E` Everybody needs sometime on their `F#` own  
`E` Don't you know you need sometime all `F#` alone   

**[Bridge]**  
`Ebm` I know it's `E` hard to keep and `B` open heart  
`Ebm` When even `E` friends seem out to `Cm` harm you  
`Ebm` But if you `E` could heal a `B` broken heart  
`Ebm` Wouldn't `E` time be out to `F#` charm you  

**[Instrumental] (x2)**  
`E` `Cm` `B`  

**[Chorus]**  
`E` Do you need sometime on your `F#` own?  
`E` Do you need sometime all `F#` alone?  
`E` Everybody needs sometime on their `F#` own  
`E` Don't you know you need sometime all `F#` alone  

**[Verse 3]**  
`E` And when your fears `Cm` subside  
And shadows still `B` remains, oh yeah  
`E` I know that you can `Cm` love me  
When there's no one left to `B` blame  
`Cm` So never mind the `F#` darkness  
We still can find a `B` way  
`Cm` Cause nothin' lasts `F#` forever  
Even cold november `F#` rain

**[Outro]**  
`Bm` Don't you you think that you `F#` need somebody  
`E` Don't you think that you `D` need someone  
`G` Everybody `A` needs somebody. `B5` You're not the only one.  You're not the only one.
