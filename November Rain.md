**[Verse 1]**  
`C` When I look into your `Am` eyes  
I can see a love `G` restrained  
`C` But darling when I `Am` hold you  
Don't you know I feel the `G` same  
`Am` Cause nothin' `D` last forever  
And we both know hearts can `G` change  
`Am` And it's hard to hold a `D` candle  
In the cold november `G` rain  

**[Verse 2]**  
`C` We've been through this such a `Am` long, long time  
Just tryin' to kill the `G` pain, oh yeah  
`C` But lovers always come and lovers always go  
And `Am` no one's really sure who's lettin' go `G` today - Walkin' away  
`C` If we could take the time to lay it on the line  
`Am` I could rest my head - Just knowin' that you were `G` mine - All mine  
`Am` So if you want to `D` love me  
Then darlin' don't `G` refrain  
`Am` Or I'll just end up `D` walkin'  
In the cold november `G` rain  

**[Chorus]**  
Do `C` you need sometime on your `D` own?  
Do you `C` need sometime all `D` alone?  
Everybody `C` needs sometime on their `D` own  
Don't you know you `C` need sometime all `D` alone  

**[Bridge]**  
`Bm` I know it's `C` hard to keep and `G` open heart  
`Bm` When even `C` friends seem out to `Am` harm you  
`Bm` But if you `C` could heal a `G` broken heart  
`Bm` Wouldn't `C` time be out to `D` charm you  

**[Instrumental] (x2)**  
`C` `Am` `G`  

**[Chorus]**  
Do `C` you need sometime on your `D` own?  
Do you `C` need sometime all `D` alone?  
Everybody `C` needs sometime on their `D` own  
Don't you know you `C` need sometime all `D` alone  

**[Verse 3]**  
`C` And when your fears `Am` subside  
And shadows still `G` remains, oh yeah  
`C` I know that you can `Am` love me  
When there's no one left to `G` blame  
`Am` So never mind the `D` darkness  
We still can find a `G` way  
`Am` Cause nothin' lasts `D` forever  
Even cold november `D` rain
