**[Verse 1]**  
`E/B` When I look into your `C#m` eyes  
I can see a love `B/Eb` restrained  
`E/B` But darling when I `C#m` hold you  
Don't you know I feel the `B/Eb` same  
`C#m` Cause nothin' last `F#/C#` forever  
And we both know hearts can `B/Eb` change  
`C#m` And it's hard to hold a `F#/C#` candle  
In the cold november `B/Eb` rain  

**[Verse 2]**  
`E/B` We've been through this such a `C#m` long, long time  
Just tryin' to kill the `B/Eb` pain, oh yeah  
`E/B` But lovers always come and lovers always go  
And `C#m` no one's really sure who's lettin' go `B/Eb` today - Walkin' away  
`E/B` If we could take the time to lay it on the line  
`C#m` I could rest my head - Just knowin' that you were `B/Eb` mine - All mine  
`C#m` So if you want to `F#/C#` love me  
Then darlin' don't `B/Eb` refrain  
`C#m` Or I'll just end up `F#/C#` walkin'  
In the cold november `B/Eb` rain  

**[Chorus]**  
`E/B` Do you need sometime on your `F#/C#` own?  
`E/B` Do you need sometime all `F#/C#` alone?  
`E/B` Everybody needs sometime on their `F#/C#` own  
`E/B` Don't you know you need sometime all `F#/C#` alone   

**[Bridge]**  
`Ebm` I know it's `E/B` hard to keep and `B/Eb` open heart  
`Ebm` When even `E/B` friends seem out to `C#m` harm you  
`Ebm` But if you `E/B` could heal a `B/Eb` broken heart  
`Ebm` Wouldn't `E/B` time be out to `F#/C#` charm you  

**[Instrumental] (x2)**  
`E/B` `C#m` `B/Eb`  

**[Chorus]**  
`E/B` Do you need sometime on your `F#/C#` own?  
`E/B` Do you need sometime all `F#/C#` alone?  
`E/B` Everybody needs sometime on their `F#/C#` own  
`E/B` Don't you know you need sometime all `F#/C#` alone  

**[Verse 3]**  
`E/B` And when your fears `C#m` subside  
And shadows still `B/Eb` remains, oh yeah  
`E/B` I know that you can `C#m` love me  
When there's no one left to `B/Eb` blame  
`C#m` So never mind the `F#/C#` darkness  
We still can find a `B/Eb` way  
`C#m` Cause nothin' lasts `F#/C#` forever  
Even cold november `B/Eb` rain

**[Outro]**  
`Bm/D` Don't you you think that you `F#/C#` need somebody  
`E/B` Don't you think that you `D` need someone  
`G/D` Everybody `A/Db` needs somebody. `B5` You're not the only one.  You're not the only one.
